### Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

After many years of experience in Human Resources ranging from recruitment to employee management, I'm very excited to start transition to tech as a Full stack Web Developer. 
I am curious and eager to learn new skills and new ways to utilize my talents- such as integrating into teams and learning things quickly. I am positive that my creativity and attention to details will come into hand.
I am looking for a position in an environment where I can grow professionally as well as collaborate with those around me.
looking forward to new challenges!
